# Adding a new Language Icon

When adding an icon for a language, please read the information below before doing so!

## Requirements

-   It should have a size of 1024x1024.
-   Please use PNG file format.
-   Recommend logo size is 512x512, if it's too small you can make it bigger.
-   We recommend using HSV instead of RGB when working with the background color, and please don't use plain color (S and V 100) unless it's really nessecary
-   You should use the official logo of the language UNLESS it's nessecary to use other icon (logo not minimal, can't find transparent version)
-   The icon should be minimalist.

## Note

If you can't make an icon, then that's fine! Just add the language name to the list in next section! future contributor might be able to work on it!

## Missing Icon List

Use the following format `(Language Name) ((Language Icon.png)) ([Link to langauge website / information about the language])` where `()` is required, `[]` is optional

Example: `C++ (cpp.png) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)`
